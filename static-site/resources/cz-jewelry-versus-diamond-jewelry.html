			CZ Jewelry Versus Diamond Jewelry<br>
			By: Sara Berkley<br><br>
			Honestly, there really is no real contention here, especially if you are literally in love with all kinds of jewelry. Even though some people may not openly express it, we all love that little sparkle, no matter what precious metal it is or what gemstone or mineral it shows off. Cubic zirconia jewelry, diamond jewelry, gold jewelry, silver jewelry … agate, turquoise, pearls … the list plainly goes on and on.<br /><br><br /><br>However, some people do find a bit of friction when it comes to the appealing cubic zirconia or cz jewelry and the ever dependable and timeless diamond jewelry. Some assert that both just can’t be of the same level. Although they both somewhat look alike, there has to be one which is, in theory, more superior. Naturally, these are two very different elements; one is naturally made while the other is man-made. So for those of you who cannot make up your minds whether you want cz jewelry or diamond jewelry, here is the full low-down:<br /><br><br /><br>CZ Jewelry<br /><br><br /><br>CZ jewelry (like diamond jewelry) never really stands alone. You will often see cz rings set on sterling silver jewelry, or a pair of cubic zirconia gems on some sterling silver earrings. CZ is a diamond stimulant, and yes, it is completely man made. This is one of the most important elements of the cubic zirconia that helps bring down the cost of the jewelry made from this material.<br /><br><br /><br>CZ can also be engineered in such a way that it is almost indistinguishable from real diamonds. It can look so alike to diamonds that often times only trained gemologists can actually spot the difference. However, one element of the CZ jewelry that makes it so popular among jewelry enthusiasts is its capacity to be engineered to diamond perfection – from the cut of the diamond, to the color, and finally to the clarity of the material.<br /><br><br /><br>Diamond Jewelry<br /><br><br /><br>We’ve all heard that saying, diamond is a girl’s best friend. Admittedly enough, most still believe that this statement is true. But diamonds and diamond jewelries are far too precious these days. They are definitely too pricey to buy on a whim. And not all of these so-called real diamond jewelries actually carry precious diamond in the first place. In fact, some pieces carry synthetic diamonds which are also known as lab-manufactured diamonds. There are even others which have enhanced diamonds. These pieces are natural diamonds which are enhanced via laser treatments. And yes, the primary concern here is always the price. Truly great diamonds have never been known to have depreciated in value.<br /><br><br /><br>Since diamonds are naturally made through a geological process there are a lot of imperfections and impurities associated with them. This is the primary reason why gemologists rank them by carat weight, clarity, color, and cut. More often than not, the diamonds that are within our budget range unfortunately end up being those that fare poorly in ranking.<br /><br><br /><br>So when it comes to the ultimate question of CZ jewelry versus diamond jewelry, it all really depends on you and your own preferences. If you are looking for something that looks stunning and just like a real diamond that is actually affordable, then CZ jewelry wins. However there is just something truly special about natural and real diamonds, regardless of their expensive price.<br><br><br>Article Source: <a href="http://www.articlesengine.com/Article/CZ-Jewelry-Versus-Diamond-Jewelry/177807/1" target=_BLANK>Articles Engine</a><br><br>
